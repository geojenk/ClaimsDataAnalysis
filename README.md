## Medical Claims Data Analysis

### Scenario
The leadership of the Health Fund is working closely with a partner clinic in Manhattan to improve outcomes and reduce costs for certain common procedures. Prior to assessing outcomes, the leadership has asked me to form a list of top 10 referral providers based on cost and volume, in the immediate vicinity of the clinic, for colonoscopy procedures. Iâ€™ll be working with a dataset containing a set of claims that encompass all colonoscopies in the clinic catchment area. 

### Audience
Technical leaders of the health fund data team (not C-suite)

### Questions from the Leadership
1. What was the total volume of colonoscopy procedures in 2020? What was the total volume by provider for the top 10 providers, by volume?
2. What are the mean and median costs per procedure for each of the top 10 providers, by volume?
3. Are the costs per procedure statistically different between the top 3 providers by volume?
4. What recommendations would you make to the clinic, based on this data, about which providers should be preferred for colonoscopy procedure?
